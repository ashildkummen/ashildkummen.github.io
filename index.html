                <h3>UCL COVID-19 Recovery Competition | 2nd Place</h3>
                <p>(2020)</p>
                <p>As part of a team of three, we developed an approach to mitigate spread of Covid-19 in hospitals
                    with guidance from Dr Rebecca Pope from KPMG. The proposal was to employ a real-time tracking system
                    where movement is recorded as a series of spatiotemporal events, and the data analysed to make causal inferences about when and where the virus spreads (Website: https://ashildkummen.github.io/traverse/).</p>
